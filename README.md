# COex SQLÂ Django task

**The brief was**: Try to design a database model for an online bookstore, which would contain at least 5 models (the more options you have the better, but no need to deal with Amazon :-) ). I leave it up to you what tool you use or whether you "shoot" the model structure directly within Django. I'm really interested in the database model and the relationships between objects. 

## Notes about solution:
- I use Django because it was preferred, even though the specification said I could use whatever I wanted. 
- So I made exactly 5 models, but I tried to choose them in such a way that you can see many possibilities how the models are connected to each other.
- The login to the administration is via `jiri:coex`.
- I've added some books and authors to the database.
- Because I use SQLite, it is easy to run it localy.
